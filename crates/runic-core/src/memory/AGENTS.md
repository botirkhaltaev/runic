Scope: `crates/runic-core/src/memory/`.

- Keep OS mapping lifecycle in `OsMemory` and `Mapping`.
- `Mapping` construction is private to `os.rs`; every `Mapping` must come from `OsMemory::map` so its `(base, len)` always describes a live, uniquely-owned mmap region (`NonZeroUsize` length, page-aligned base, page-multiple len). Do not widen this constructor's visibility as a shortcut.
- `OsMemory` has no raw `unmap` escape hatch. Anything that owns mmap'd storage must hold a `Mapping` (or a type that owns one) and rely on `Drop` to release it; do not reintroduce `mem::forget`-plus-manual-`munmap` patterns.
- `AddressRange` is ownership-free `(base, len)` geometry (e.g. extent user sub-ranges). Do not put munmap or uniqueness on it.
- Keep pointer lookup and ownership publication in `PageMap`.
- `PageMap` owns L1 mmap as `l1_mapping: Mutex<Option<Mapping>>` and publishes the table through `l1: AtomicPtr<L1Table>` for lock-free `get`. Each `L1Entry` publishes its L2 through `AtomicPtr` and keeps `L2Mapping` (L2 `Mapping` + occupied page count) behind that same `l1_mapping` lock — not an empty `Mutex<()>` and not writer-only atomics. Do not reintroduce token locks or `MaybeUninit` mapping cells.
- `PageMap::{publish_run,publish_extent,unpublish_extent}` take `&Mapping` (not a raw `AddressRange`). Preserve `PageOwner` pointer lifetime assumptions: owners stay live until their page-map range is removed.
- `PageMap` has exactly one in-memory representation per published range: every page in a run or extent range gets a direct per-page entry. Do not add a second encoding (e.g. a span/run-length record) that `PageMap` silently falls back to when the primary one is exhausted or unavailable; if a future optimization needs a denser encoding, replace the representation everywhere rather than layering a fallback next to it.
- Extents use `publish_extent` / `unpublish_extent`. Runs only `publish_run` today: empty-run reclaim is not implemented, so do not add a dead `unpublish_run` (or `#[allow(dead_code)]`) ahead of that work. When reclaim lands, add `unpublish_run` with its first real caller in the same change.
- `PageOwner` stays a concrete `Run`/`Extent` enum rather than an opaque `NonNull` + kind tag: callers in `allocator.rs`, `heap/run/heap.rs`, and `heap/extent/heap.rs` pattern-match on it and immediately dereference the typed pointer, so erasing the type would only add casts at every call site without removing any duplication. `MapEntry` already carries the kind bit needed for compact storage; revisit `PageOwner` only if a caller needs to hold page-map results without knowing the arena type.
- `L1Table` is sized for the full 48-bit address space and relies on the OS to lazily back it with physical pages; it is not densified in v0.5. Revisit only with a profile showing L1 reservation or first-touch cost matters.
- Keep unsafe pointer/provenance code narrow and adjacent to safety comments.
- Add page-map tests for overlap, removal, and L2 boundary behavior when changing lookup logic.
